<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
<p>Makes players drop their own head if they are killed by another player.<br>The head will drop at the location the player was killed at.</p>
<p><strong>If you want the player to always drop their head, no matter who killed them, use <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/headdrops/Headdrops_v2.0.0.zip">v2.0.0</a> instead.</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-up">How to set up</h2>
<h3 id="version-20-114-and-above">Version 2.0 (1.14) and above:</h3>
<p>Download the zip file and place it into your <code>world/datapacks</code> folder. If the world is already running, run <code>reload</code>. That&#39;s all you need to do.  </p>
<h3 id="version-10-113">Version 1.0 (1.13):</h3>
<p>After the datapack has been added to your world, it still needs some manual editing for it to work with your own skulls.
Open up the file <code>data/headdrop/functions/drop.mcfunction</code> and add one of the following lines for each of your players, obviously replacing <code>Playername</code> with the actual name of the player:</p>
<pre><code>execute at @a[scores={headDeath=1..},name=Playername] run summon item ~ ~ ~ {Item:{id:player_head,Count:1,tag:{SkullOwner:Playername}}}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="additional-info">Additional Info</h3>
<p>Skulls that are dropped like this won&#39;t stack with the ones that have been placed and broken again, because the game converts the name of the SkullOwner into the texture.</p>

<p>Homes allow you to save positions in the world and teleport to them whenever you want, including different dimensions.</p>
<p>This Datapack allows you to set unlimited homes in any world. The players of the world don&#39;t need OP to use the commands.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-up">How to set up</h2>
<p>Download the zip file and place it into your <code>world/datapacks</code> folder. If the world is already running, run <code>reload</code>. That&#39;s all you need to do.  </p>
<p>You can look at the ingame-help for the datapack by running</p>
<pre><code>/trigger home.help
</code></pre>
<p>But while you&#39;re here you might as well read the long explanation below ↓</p>
<h2 id="commands-explanations">Commands explanations</h2>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<ul>
<li>All commands need to be prefaced with <code>/trigger</code>.  </li>
<li>Some of the commands allow you to specify a specific home (the ones annotated with &quot;(set #)&quot;). You will always have to identify the home by its ID and cannot identify it via its name.  </li>
<li>If you&#39;re not specifying a specific home in a command that allows for it, it will default to home number 1.  </li>
<li>Negative values are ignored.  </li>
<li><em>There are no undos.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specific-commands">Specific commands</h3>
<p><code>/trigger home.help</code><br>Display the ingame help page.</p>
<p><code>/trigger home (set #)</code><br>Teleport to one of your homes. Defaults to Home #1 if nothing else is specified.</p>
<p><code>/trigger home.set (set #)</code><br>Set a new home location. This command will also override a home if set to an existing number.</p>
<p><code>/trigger home.delete (set #)</code><br>Deletes the specified home.  </p>
<p><code>/trigger home.list</code><br>Lists all your homes in a list with their ids, coordinates and names.</p>
<p><code>/trigger home.set_name (set #)</code><br>Sets the name of the specified home to the name of the item in your hand. <strong>The item needs to be renamed in an anvil for it to work.</strong> If it isn&#39;t or your hand is empty, it will not change the name.</p>
<h2 id="further-information">Further Information</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>If you want to move your spawnchunks, you&#39;ll have to run this command afterwards to keep the datapack working:</strong></p>
<pre><code>teleport @e[type=area_effect_cloud,tag=pla_home] x y z
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>replace <code>x y z</code> with your new worldspawn coordinates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Homes are running out ~3 years (real time) after you&#39;ve created them. If this is a concern for you, reach out to me and I&#39;ll let you know how to extend it by another 3 years.  </li>
<li>Homes work up to 2^25 - 1 (33554431) blocks in both positive and negative x and z direction as well as 0-255 in y direction. This covers the whole possible minecraft world. Don&#39;t try to set a Home at the Farlands is what I&#39;m trying to say.</li>
<li>Homes are only compatible with the three vanilla versions overworld, nether and end. Custom Dimensions are not supported.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="uninstalling">Uninstalling</h4>
<p>To remove all traces of the pack from your world you can run the <code>homes:uninstall</code> function before you deactivate the datapack (or delete it from your world folder). <strong>This will remove all set homes for everyone</strong> as well as remove all the scoreboard objectives it&#39;s using. If you just deactivate the pack and reactivate it again afterwards, all the homes will still be there.</p>

<h2 id="this-datapack-has-been-made-obsolete-by-the-117-playerssleepingpercentage-gamerule"><span style="color:red">This datapack has been made obsolete by the 1.17 <code>playersSleepingPercentage</code> gamerule.</span></h2>
<p>It is advised that you use that instead.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
<p>This Datapack is intended for larger survival servers. It allows the OPs of the server to set a percentage of players required to sleep to skip the night.
So if you want to skip the night if half of the players playing are in a bed, set the percentage to 50%.</p>
<p>When a player is trying to pass the night, a message in chat with how many players are left as well as an advancement will make other online players aware of this intent.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-up">How to set up</h2>
<p>Download the zip file and place it into your <code>world/datapacks</code> folder. If the world is already running, run <code>reload</code>. That&#39;s all you need to do.<br>That way it has been set to <strong>10% as a standard</strong>. To change that, use the following command in chat (replace XX with your desired percentage):</p>
<pre><code>scoreboard players set requiredPercent multSleep.count XX
</code></pre>
<p>This number can be changed at any time you want.</p>
<h2 id="further-information">Further Information</h2>
<p>This datapack will...</p>
<ul>
<li>...always require a minimum of 1 player to sleep.  </li>
<li>...round down the required players. So if the percentage is set to 50% and 3 players are online, 1.5 players need to sleep, which the pack rounds down to one.  </li>
<li>...clear the weather whenever the night is skipped for 999999 seconds. If you&#39;d rather have the &quot;normal&quot; behaviour of it turning to sun for a limited but random amount of time, you can swap out the <code>skip.mcfunction</code> file for <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/multiplayer_sleep/skip.mcfunction">this one</a>  </li>
<li>...not interfere with the phantom timer. If you are in a bed, the timer resets, as always.  </li>
<li>...only consider players in the overworld when counting how many players need to sleep.</li>
<li>...add to the time instead of setting it, so you won&#39;t loose your time played/ingame days</li>

<h1 id="world-preloadingpre-generation">World Preloading/Pre-Generation</h1>
<p><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/preload_world/preload_worldv1.2.zip">latest version (v1.2)</a> (1.13+)<br><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/preload_world/preload_worldv1.1.zip">(v1.1)</a> (1.13+)<br><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/preload_world/preload_worldv1.0.zip">(v1.0)</a> (1.13+)</p>
<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
<p>This datapack will allow you to easily pre-generate/preload your world, for when you want to play e.g. survival and don&#39;t want your server to be generating the world (aka lagging) while you&#39;re exploring for the first few thousand blocks. <strong>This is especially important in multiplayer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This datapack is intended to be run BEFORE you play in a world, but will still work after you&#39;ve played for a while as well.</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-up">How to set up</h2>
<p><strong>This datapack has only been tested in singleplayer and it is recommended that you use it in singleplayer or on a server where you&#39;re the only one online. While it shouldn&#39;t cause any issues to do it on a server (except for the lag you&#39;re trying to prevent when doing this), you should not do that unless you have to!</strong></p>
<p>Download the zip file and place it into your <code>world/datapacks</code> folder. If the world is already running, run <code>reload</code>. Then join the world if you aren&#39;t already, make sure all the settings are correct and run the function command that starts the process.</p>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The generation will use the player to load all the chunks, this is why it&#39;s important to set the settings correctly. Make sure you go through ALL the settings and make sure they are correct. All of these settings have a default value. If you&#39;re fine with those values, you can keep them that way.</p>
<p>To change a setting, run this command in chat, replacing <code>&lt;settingName&gt;</code> with the name of the setting you want to change and <code>&lt;value&gt;</code> with the value this setting should have now.</p>
<pre><code>/scoreboard players set &lt;settingName&gt; pl.settings &lt;value&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="displaying-the-settings">Displaying the settings</h3>
<p>All settings are scoreboard scores, which can be shown by setting the scoreboard <code>pl.settings</code> to be viewed on the sidebar like this:  </p>
<pre><code>/scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar pl.settings
</code></pre>
<h3 id="setgamerules">setGamerules</h3>
<p><em>Default: 1</em><br>If <code>setGamerules</code> is set to 1, it will set the gamerules <code>doDaylightCycle</code>, <code>doWeatherCycle</code> and <code>doMobSpawning</code> to false at the beginning and to true at the end of the generation. Set it to 0 to disable this functionality.<br><em>Please note that the <code>spectatorsGenerateChunks</code> gamerule will always be set to true, no matter what these settings are.</em></p>
<h3 id="renderdistance">renderDistance</h3>
<p><em>Default: 8</em><br>You need to set <code>renderDistance</code> to your clients (singleplayer) or your servers (multiplayer) render distance, as that is important for the size of the steps the generation can make. You can also set it to a lower number than your actual render distance for a less resource intensive generation.</p>
<h3 id="waittime">waitTime</h3>
<p><em>Default: 40 (2 seconds)</em><br><code>waitTime</code> describes the amount of ticks (there are 20 ticks per second) between each step of the generation. If your computer is stronger, you might be able to decrease this value (I&#39;d recommend not to go below 20), if your computer has trouble keeping up, increase this number.<br>This, together with <code>renderDistance</code> is the factor with the biggest impact on your processor, so tweak as necessary.</p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<h4 id="center">Center</h4>
<p><em>Default: 0</em><br>The center position around which you want to pre-generate your world can be set using <code>X</code> and <code>Z</code>. These values are independant of each other.</p>
<h4 id="width">Width</h4>
<p><em>Default: 1024</em><br>To set the size of your pre-generated area, use <code>DX</code> and <code>DZ</code>. These describe the side length of the generated area, centered around <code>X</code> and <code>Z</code> <em>(not around worldspawn!)</em>. This means that the default value of 1024 will pre-generate the area from <code>-512 ~ -512</code> to <code>+512 ~ +512</code> (assuming <code>X</code> and <code>Z</code> are set to their default of 0). These values are independant of each other.<br>Be aware that the generated area is <em>at least</em> the size given in <code>DX</code> and <code>DZ</code>, and will most likely be a little bit bigger depending on many factors.</p>
<h3 id="dimension">Dimension</h3>
<p><em>Default: 1</em><br>You can set which dimension you want to pre-generate. For this, set each of <code>overworld</code>, <code>nether</code> and <code>end</code> to either 1 (pre-generate) or 0 (don&#39;t pre-generate). You cannot set different settings (generation size, wait time etc) for different dimensions, so if you want/need that, you&#39;ll have to run them one after the other.<br><em>This is the only setting that is changed to 0 after a run is completed to prevent accidental re-runs!</em></p>
<h2 id="running-the-generation">Running the Generation</h2>
<p>Once all the settings are set appropriately, run the following command as the player in the game:</p>
<pre><code>/function preload:run
</code></pre>
<p>After this, you will be teleported around a lot. Once the process has finished, you will be teleported to the worldspawn. The actionbar will inform you about the current progress.</p>
<p><strong>This process takes a while and only runs while the player is in the world!</strong></p>
<h2 id="aborting-the-generation">Aborting the Generation</h2>
<p>If for whatever reason you want to abort the generation, you can run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>/function preload:run/done
</code></pre>
<p><em>Please note that you will not be able to resume the generation once aborted and will have to restart!</em></p>
<h2 id="uninstalling">Uninstalling</h2>
<p>If you wish to uninstall/remove the pack, run the following function before you remove it, so you don&#39;t have any leftover data in your world that you don&#39;t need:</p>
<pre><code>/function preload:uninstall
</code></pre>

<p>This number can be changed at any time you want.</p>
<p><strong>Be aware that using this sponge especially with higher maximum numbers will lag the server!</strong></p>
<h2 id="customisation">Customisation</h2>
<p>You can easily customize which blocks you want the sponge to replace.<br>For this, open up the <code>replace.json</code> file located inside the pack at <code>SuperSponge_vXXX/data/fill_sponge/tags/block(s)/replace.json</code> and change the <code>values</code> tag to be whatever you want to replace.</p>
<p>Here are three examples that you can download (<code>rightclick &gt; save target as</code>). You&#39;ll need to replace the <code>replace.json</code> file with one of these, renaming it to <code>replace.json</code>.</p>

<h1 id="hardcore-realm">Hardcore Realm</h1>
<p>A small datapack that turns your realm into hardcore mode, by putting everyone who dies into spectator mode.<br>Has a mode for &quot;super hardcore&quot;, aka one person dies, everyone gets set to spectator, starting version 1.1.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/hardcore_realm/hardcore_realm_v1.3.zip">latest version (v1.3), 1.18+</a><br><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/hardcore_realm/hardcore_realm_v1.2.zip">v1.2 (1.16 - 1.17)</a><br><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/hardcore_realm/hardcore_realm_v1.1.zip">v1.1</a><br><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/hardcore_realm/hardcore_realm_v1.0.zip">v1.0</a></p>

<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
<p>This datapack will turn your realm basically into a hardcore world, by putting anyone who died once into spectator mode. Or, if you configure it that way, it will even set everyone into spectator mode if even ONE player dies.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-up">How to set up</h2>
<h3 id="existing-world">Existing world</h3>
<p>Download the zip file and place it into your world/datapacks folder. If the world is already running, run reload. That&#39;s all you need to do.</p>

<li>Reupload the world to the realm.</li>

<h2 id="how-to-change-to-super-hardcore">How to change to <strong>Super Hardcore</strong></h2>
<p>To change the world to super hardcore (aka if any player dies, everyone gets set to spectator mode), just run this simple command in the chat:</p>
<pre><code>/scoreboard players set #superHardcore deaths 1
</code></pre>
<p>To set it back to &quot;normal&quot; hardcore, change the <code>1</code> to a <code>0</code>.</p>
<p><em>Please note: once someone died while it was set to super hardcore, it doesn&#39;t automatically reset everyone else who didn&#39;t die if you set it back to normal!</em></p>
<h3 id="super-hardcore-light">Super Hardcore light</h3>
<p>In <strong>version 1.3</strong> the &quot;super hardcore light&quot; mode was introduced, which gives the server as a whole a contingent of lives. To enable it, just set the amount of lives your server should have available through the same command as above.</p>
<pre><code>/scoreboard players set #superHardcore deaths X
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>X</code> is the total amount of deaths you want to allow.  </p>
<p><em>Please note: In this mode individual deaths don&#39;t cause a change to spectator mode, so a player might die multiple times and take away multiple deaths from the amount of lives available.</em> </p>

<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
<p>This datapack allows you to have individual timers, show the remaining time in the actionbar and send a message as well as a title to the player once their timer is up.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-up">How to set up</h2>
<p>Download the zip file and place it into your <code>world/datapacks</code> folder. If the world is already running, run <code>reload</code>. That&#39;s all you need to do, the pack will set up all it needs itself.  </p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to use</h2>
<p>All of the controls are run through trigger commands. To set the value of a trigger, run <code>/trigger &lt;triggername&gt; set|add &lt;value&gt;</code>.  </p>
<p><code>/trigger &lt;triggername&gt; add 1</code> can be abbreviated as <code>/trigger &lt;triggername&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><strong>All timers are personal timers. There are no global timers in this pack.</strong></p>
<h4 id="controls">Controls</h4>
<p>The basic control triggers are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li><code>timer.start</code><br>starts a new timer. if the timer has been paused previously, it will resume the timer. uses the set hours, minutes and seconds set through the options when using a new timer.  </li>
<li><code>timer.stop</code><br>stops the current timer.  </li>
<li><code>timer.pause</code><br>pauses the timer. can be resumed where it paused by running <code>timer.start</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="options">Options</h4>
<p>There are a bunch of different options you can set and use to run the timer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>timer.seconds</code><br>The amount of seconds the timer should use when starting a new timer. Default: 0</p>

<h3 id="changelog">Changelog</h3>
<h4 id="10">1.0</h4>
<p>20.03.2021 released</p>
</div><div class="pack-big" id="elevators"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/master/elevators/banner.png" alt="Elevators Banner" title="Bee Info"></p>
<h1 id="elevators">Elevators</h1>
<p><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/elevators/elevators_v1.0.0.zip">latest version (v1.0)</a> (1.20+)</p>
<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
<p>It basically adds the elevator blocks from the OpenBlocks mod to the vanilla game.</p>
<p><em>Please note: Due to a limitation of how custom crafting can currently be done, the elevator block looks like a jigsaw block and is also called that until crafted.</em></p>
<p>The elevator blocks can be crafted from 8 wool surrounding an ender pearl in a crafting bench.</p>
<p>When placed on the same x/z coordinate and jumping / sneaking, they will teleport you up / down to the next elevator directly above / below. An elevator is only considered operational if the two blocks direcly above it are air.</p>
<p><strong>By default, all elevators link to all elevators</strong>, but through the <em>settings</em> you can enable <strong>colors mode</strong>, which allows you to dye elevators and link only elevators with the same dye.</p>
<p>Also in the settings you can set an xp cost to use an elevator.</p>
<p>Thanks to new tech introduced in 1.20, you can even <strong>camouflage your elevator block by just rightclicking it with any block</strong>.  </p>
<p>To <strong>remove</strong> an elevator, <strong>hit it with a pickaxe</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-up">How to set up</h2>
<p>Download the zip file and place it into your <code>world/datapacks</code> folder. If the world is already running, run <code>reload</code>. That&#39;s all you need to do for it to start working.  </p>
<p>However, have a look at the following settings to customize your experience.</p>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>This datapack comes with some settings that you can adjust to customize your experience. All settings are changed by running this command in chat:</p>
<pre><code>scoreboard players set &lt;setting&gt; elevator.settings &lt;value&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="range">range</h3>
<p><em>Default: 384</em><br>Limits the maximum distance an elevator can teleport a player. By default it&#39;s the entire world height. <strong>Setting it to a value below 3 will render all elevators useless.</strong></p>
<h3 id="samecolor">sameColor</h3>
<p><em>Default: 0</em><br>If set to <code>1</code>, elevators will only teleport players to elevators with the same color. It is recommended to also enable <code>showColor</code> when turning this on. <strong>Rightclick an elevator with a dye to change its color.</strong></p>
<h3 id="showcolor">showColor</h3>
<p><em>Default: 0</em><br>If set to <code>1</code>, elevators will display the color they have been set to with a small particle. Also useful to see where elevators are.</p>
<h3 id="requirexp">requireXP</h3>
<p><em>Default: 0</em><br>A value &gt;0 required players to pay with this amount of experience points (not levels!) to use an elevator. If they have less XP than this value, they won&#39;t be able to use an elevator.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>In case some parts of the datapack don&#39;t work as expected anymore (crafting, placing, breaking, interacting), here is a simple steps you can take to try to resolve them:</p>
<p>Because a lot of things are triggered through advancements, so running <code>advancement revoke Player from elevator:root</code> should reset those triggers for the &quot;Player&quot;. This should fix most issues.</p>

<h1 id="116-version-30">1.16+ Version (3.0)</h1>
<p><em>If you&#39;re using the old version, a lot has changed since then in terms of features. For that reason you can find the old instructions below</em>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How to play</h2>
<p>The premise is easy: Find every item in the game and return it to the shrine.<br>The problem: There are <strong>888</strong> different items in the game obtainable in survival.  </p>
<p>All you have to do is move up to the shrine (of your team) and place the items you want to register into the chest. <strong>Be aware that that will consume the item</strong> (if it hasn&#39;t been handed in before). Note that you need to stand close to the shrine to activate and actually check your items, or it won&#39;t work.<br>You can toggle a number in the actionbar that displays the total amount of found items of your team, by using <code>/trigger displayScore 1/0</code> in chat.<br>Your progress will also be tracked on the advancement screen. There you can see what items you have already collected and which ones are left.</p>
<p>Around the shrine, once placed, is an &quot;adventure mode&quot; area, that will prevent you from building or breaking any blocks in close proximity to the shrine.<br>It will also protect itself against creeper explosions.</p>
<h2 id="whats-new">What&#39;s new</h2>
<p>In the 3.0 Version of this datapack, I&#39;ve added <strong>Teams</strong>, <strong>multiple shrines</strong> and a possibility for <strong>custom advancement layouts</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-up">How to set up</h2>
<h3 id="shrine">Shrine</h3>
<p>Download the zip file and place it into your <code>world/datapacks</code> folder. If the world is already running, run <code>reload</code>. That&#39;s all you need to do. Now you need to find a good place for the shrine(s) to be placed.
if you think you&#39;ve found that place, stand there and run</p>
<pre><code>/function itemchallenge:spawn_shrine
</code></pre>
<p>After placement you&#39;ll notice the adventure mode aura around the shrine. If you want/need to place blocks around the shrine, you have to switch to creative mode. The only things you must not change about the shrine is the chest, hopper and dropper.</p>
<p>You can place as many shrines as you want. Just make sure they don&#39;t overlap, so keep a few blocks distance between them.</p>
<h4 id="removing-a-shrine">Removing a shrine</h4>
<p>To be able to fully remove a shrine you&#39;ll need to stand where the shrine is/was located and run</p>
<pre><code>kill @e[type=area_effect_cloud,tag=itemchallenge,limit=1,sort=nearest]
</code></pre>
<p>to remove the marker entity that marks the position of the shrine. You know it worked when the dropper stops clicking even when players are close. </p>
<h4 id="signs">Signs</h4>
<p>The signs in the shrines will automatically update, but only if they are placed in the positions they are already in. They show the teamid and current score. They also allow players to join that team. You can enable/disable this functionality by setting <code>signJoinEnabled</code> in <code>ic.settings</code> to either 0 or 1.</p>
<pre><code>/scoreboard players set signJoinEnabled ic.settings 0
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that the signs as well as the actionbar display have some delay in their updates, for performance reasons.</p>
<p>You can break the signs and customize their rotation and type. Also line 3 is free for you to fill with whatever you want.</p>
<h3 id="teams">Teams</h3>
<p>Teams are represented by a number. A newly spawned shrine will be in team 0 by default.</p>
<p>You can change a shrines team by standing at the shrine and running </p>
<pre><code>/scoreboard players set @e[type=area_effect_cloud,tag=itemchallenge,limit=1,sort=nearest] ic.team &lt;teamNumber&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>replace <code>&lt;teamNumber&gt;</code> with the number of the team you want the shrine to join. By assigning a shrine to a new number, that team will be created automatically. You can change a shrines number at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Adding more teams will put exponentially more stress on the server with every team. So be conservative with the amount of teams you add. I&#39;ve tested 4 and it worked fine, it depends on your server, just don&#39;t go crazy.</li>
<li>Always add the next number first (0, 1, 2, 3, ..), as the game assumes all previous teams also exist (so setting it to 420 will create 420 teams, which will cause lots of lag!)</li>
<li>Once a team has been created, you cannot remove it anymore.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="custom-layouts">Custom Layouts</h2>
<p>Since the full list of items in the advancement screen is hard (and laggy) to read, it is highly recommended to use a custom layout instead.</p>
<p>There is currently <strong>1</strong> custom layout available for download:</p>
<h3 id="alphabetical">Alphabetical</h3>
<ul>
<li><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/itemchallenge/custom_layouts/itemchallenge_v3.19_alphabetical">1.19</a></li>
<li><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/itemchallenge/custom_layouts/itemchallenge_v3.18_alphabetical">1.18</a></li>
<li><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/itemchallenge/custom_layouts/itemchallenge_v3.17_alphabetical">1.17</a></li>
<li><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/itemchallenge/custom_layouts/itemchallenge_v3.16_alphabetical">1.16</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-set-up-1">How to set up</h3>
<p>Download your desired layout, put it into the datapacks folder and make sure it is applied <strong>on top</strong> of the itemchallenge base pack.</p>
<h3 id="make-your-own">Make your own</h3>
<p>I have written a small script that allows you to create your own layouts fairly easily. <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/itemchallenge/custom_layouts/generator.zip">Download here</a>, unzip it into your datapacks folder and read the instructions inside the <code>itemchallenge_advancements_override/generator</code> folder. You need node.js to run this script.</p>
<p>Of course you can also create your own layout from scratch, as long as you keep the file names I&#39;ve established it will work no problem.</p>
<p>This is somewhat advanced and is not recommended for beginners.</p>
<p>If you came up with a cool pack that has an interesting grouping, please share it with me and if I like it, I&#39;ll put it up to download on this page here as well.<br>If you have questions or run into any issues with this, let me know (contact see below).</p>

<h2 id="how-to-play-1">How to play</h2>
<p>The premise is easy: Find every item in the game and return it to the shrine.<br>The problem: There are 704 different items in the game obtainable in survival.  </p>

if you think you&#39;ve found that place, stand there and run</p>
<pre><code>/function itemchallenge:spawn_shrine
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure you have found the best spot, as having mutltiple shrines will break the pack.</p>
<p>After placement you&#39;ll notice the adventure mode aura around the shrine. If you want/need to place blocks around the shrine, you have to switch to creative mode.</p>
<h2 id="further-information">Further Information</h2>
<p>Originally created for <em>Hardcore Hermits</em>, a series on the <a target='_blank' href="http://hermitcraft.com/">Hermitcraft</a> Server. Idea by <a target='_blank' href="http://xisumavoid.com/">Xisumavoid</a>.</p>
<h3 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h3>
<p>It is possible to play this datapack in multiplayer, but the scores are counted for the whole world and not individually per player.</p>
<h3 id="episodes">Episodes</h3>
<p>That is why there is a &quot;episode&quot; mechanic built into this datapack. If you are a youtuber yourself and want timed 20 minute Episodes to play by, use </p>
<pre><code>/trigger startEpisode
</code></pre>
<p>to start the timer. When the episode is over, you will get a message in chat as well as a title on screen informing you that it is over.<br><em>Using this feature will stop the daylight circle once the episode is over and reenable it when a new episode is started!</em></p>
<h3 id="problems-that-may-occur">Problems that may occur</h3>
<p>The most common problem is that an item isn&#39;t detected eventhough it should be. That is most definitly because of one reason:<br>As soon as no player is in close proximity to the shrine anymore, the shrine stops detecting items (for lag reasons). So if you put in an item to get detected, just wait around the shrine for a few seconds,

<h3 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h3>
<p>It is possible to play this datapack in multiplayer, but the scores are counted for the whole world and not individually per player.</p>
<p>A second pack that tracks per player is in the works.</p>
<h3 id="problems-that-may-occur">Problems that may occur</h3>
<p>When in multiplayer you kill a mob while another player is offline, they won&#39;t recieve the updated advancements when they come back online until someone kills something they haven&#39;t killed yet.</p>
