## What it does

This datapack allows for the creation of super sponges that effectively remove all water in a large area.

Craftable by default by throwing 6 regular sponges and 3 nether stars onto the ground together. Can easily be adjusted to whatever fits your servers needs. (If you need help with that, [feel free to reach out](http://plagiatus.net/#contact)).

## How to set up

Download the zip file and place it into your `world/datapacks` folder. If the world is already running, run `reload`. That's all you need to do.  
That way it has been set to **10 blocks range**. To change that, use the following command in chat (replace XX with your desired range):

    /scoreboard players set maximum fillsponge XX

This number can be changed at any time you want.

**Be aware that using this sponge especially with higher maximum numbers will lag the server!**

## Customisation

You can easily customize which blocks you want the sponge to replace.  
For this, open up the `replace.json` file located inside the pack at `SuperSponge_vXXX/data/fill_sponge/tags/block(s)/replace.json` and change the `values` tag to be whatever you want to replace.

Here are three examples that you can download (`rightclick > save target as`). You'll need to replace the `replace.json` file with one of these, renaming it to `replace.json`.
