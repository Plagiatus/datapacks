# Bee Nest Info

## OUTDATED AS OF 24w35a (1.21.2) - now included in the vanilla game

[latest version (v1.0)](https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/raw/master/bee_nest_info/bee_nest_info_v1.0.0.zip) (1.16+)


## What it does

This datapack adds a little text to beehives and bee nests items that displays the amount of bees that are inside of it. No more counting and hoping it includes 3 bees, just mine it with a silk touch pick and get the info directly.

## How to set up

Download the zip file and place it into your `world/datapacks` folder. If the world is already running, run `reload`. That's all you need to do.
